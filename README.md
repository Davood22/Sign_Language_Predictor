Generally, humans communicate with each other by means of voice. But how do a dumb person communicate with other humans? They use a sign language to communicate with others. 
One can anticipate that within a few decades, digital technology would have a significant impact on how people go about their daily lives and 
that everyone will communicate with machines either by gestures or speech recognition. If we are able to foresee such a future, we should consider the physically disabled and take action to help them. 
The current proposed idea recognizes the gesture based on the American Sign Language expressed by the dumb person using deep learning.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the type of neural network and its pretrained MobileNet model used in this study.
improve the predictability of the alphabet in American Sign Language (ASL).
